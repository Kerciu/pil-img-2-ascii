## Running

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python interpreter installed on your computer.
2. Clone this project to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing this project.
4. Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    py ./mainApp.py --file-name <image_file_name> --output-file <output_file_name> [--dim-width <image_width>] [--dim-height <image_height>] [--erase-white]
    ```

    Where:
    - `<image_file_name>`: The path to the image file you want to convert to ASCII art.
    - `<output_file_name>`: The name of the file where the generated ASCII art will be saved.
    - `<image_width>` (optional): The optional width of the resulting image (in pixels). If not specified, the image will be scaled proportionally to the height.
    - `<image_height>` (optional): The optional height of the resulting image (in pixels). If not specified, the image will be scaled proportionally to the width.
    - `--erase-white` (optional): An option to remove white background from the generated ASCII art.

Example:

```bash
py ./mainApp.py --file-name image.jpg --output-file result.txt --dim-width 100 --dim-height 50 --erase-white
```

## Notes

- The `--dim-width` and `--dim-height` arguments are optional. If not provided, the image will be scaled proportionally.
- The `--erase-white` option removes white background from the generated ASCII art.
- Make sure to provide the correct path to the image file and the name of the output file.
